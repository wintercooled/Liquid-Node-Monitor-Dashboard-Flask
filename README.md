# NodeMonitor is a simple Python Flask website that makes calls to Bitcoin (bitcoind) and Lightning Network (c-lightning lightningd) nodes and displays the results on a simple 'dashboard' style status page.

If you prefer to work with **Django** there is a completed and working Django version [here](https://github.com/wintercooled/NodeMonitor-Python-Django).

This Flask version is work in progress - I don't have much time to spemnd on it right now :-|
